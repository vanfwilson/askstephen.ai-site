STORYBRANDING strategy requires 5 carefully phrased soundbites that are Plain, Simple, with high emotion and low or 0 cognitive load 
and something they need to do in order to achieve a transformation that leads to a desired end result.  
I used algotythms to calculate three aspects of each word and phrase / soundbit
emotional sentiment analysis, cognitive load calculation, and specificity (vs vague words) analysis. 

Our 5 soundbites for reference:

Problem: "In your business, do you ever stay up late, frustrated or worried about what to do next?" as a question.   
as a quick solution statement to show what we solve:  "PICK ONE STRATEGY -- Never worry about what to do again"
this assumes "You" and "in your business" but this also works in life.

Empathy: "Stephen spent decades as a CEO and business coach feeling the same strain, until he found what really works.
when you Pick One Strategy, you always know what to do in your business—and why."

Solution: "All you need is Ask Stephen and Pick One Strategy."

Transformation: "You will discover your ONE best strategy..."

End Result: "More Peace. More Profit."

Within 2 seconds, people need to know c;early by math analysis with 100% correct sentiment and low to zero cognitive load (not vague, no confusion) :

Where they are (Pick One Strategy)
What they get (the promise)

Here's the tension:
Approach          Message                                Why it works 
Pain-focused      "Never worry about what to do again."   Speaks to their current suffering
Benefit-focused   "More Peace. More Profit."              Shows the outcome they want

"Never worry about what to do again" is:

✅ Addresses current pain (push away from something bad)
❌ Slightly longer
❌ Negative framing (worry) rather than positive framing that seems cerebral. 

"More Peace. More Profit." is:

✅ Shorter (4 words vs 7)
✅ Scannable in 2 seconds
✅ Aspirational (pull toward something good)
✅ Memorable (rhythmic, alliterative)
✅ Works for business AND life

(spiritual - take action):

4 PROVEN STRATEGIES: FOCUS ON YOUR BEST PATH

Headline (intellectual - discovery):

When you find your one best strategy,
you'll always know what to do in your business and why.

So the flow is:

Focus (action, walking the path) — what they need to DO
Find (discovery, understanding) — what they'll KNOW

Faith + Works. Head + Heart. Makes sense for the Christian stewardship angle.
