🧠 3. AI Chatbot → CRM Sync

Bot Role:
Your AskStephen.ai “Guru” chatbot engages visitors, answers questions, and collects data like:

Business name

Annual revenue range

Primary goals or challenges

Contact email

Technical Connection:

The chatbot (Node.js / React) uses your CRM’s REST API to create contacts and push transcripts.

Example endpoint:
/api/crm/create-lead → saves chat history, assigns tags.

Behavior:

If user requests “strategy review,” bot:

Creates CRM contact

Sends alert email to info@askstephen.ai

Books a call via Calendly API
