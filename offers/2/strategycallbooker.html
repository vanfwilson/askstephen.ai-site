		<h2>SIGN UP PAGE</h2>
		
		<p>
			The <b>signup.html</b> page requires an opt-in form to be added.
		</p><p>
		You can use any autoresponder service you like. i.e.Aweber or GetResponse or any other.
		</p><p>
		Create an opt-in form with your chosen autoresponder or email service and replace the current form on the signup.html page.
		</p><p>
		See form for editing between  --  REPLACE THE FORM BELOW WITH YOUR OWN OPT_IN FORM -- and  --  REPLACE THE FORM ABOVE WITH YOUR OWN OPT_IN FORM --
		</p><p>
		Alternatively you could replace the signup.html page completely with one from your autoresponder or email service app. Many email services now offer that option.
		</p><p>
		In any case you do need to set the redirect or final destination page to the thankyou page i.e. https://yoursite.com/thankyou.html. This is the page that leads will be sent to after they opt-in.
